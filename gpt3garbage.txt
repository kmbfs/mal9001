Write some opening remarks for a winter wedding of a couple inspired by technology:

We are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage of two people who met online and fell in love. With everything around us constantly changing, it's amazing that something as old fashioned as falling in love still happens every day. Technology may have brought them together, but it is their love that will keep them strong for years to come.
The contributions of data processing and the internet are many, and contributed greatly to the foundations of their relationship. The bride and groom share an appreciation of computers and algorithmic thinking, which has forged a strong bond between them.
This day would not be possible without modern technology, and we thank all the engineers who have helped make this wedding possible. Who doesn't love computers? Not these two! They have hacked their way into each other's hearts, and we are all lucky to witness their love today. Before we begin the ceremony, does anyone have any objections to this union? If True: We can't have algorithms without mistakes, but through thick and thin, these two continue to prove that love conquers all. I'll conclude with a witty computer joke: Why did the floppy disk cross the road? To get to the other side!

Now, let's begin the ceremony!


To the couple that can't live without their phones, laptops, and tablets. May your love be as strong as your Wi-Fi signal. And may you never run out of batteries while arguing in bed. Cheers!

To the happy couple - may your union be as functional and error-free as possible! Congrats on finding someone who can tolerate you, and here's to hoping that this marriage is everything you hoped for... minus all the glitches.
Friends, we are here to celebrate the marriage of two people who share a common love - computer programming. But why do I get the feeling that this is not what brought them together? No, it was probably their shared love of complaining about bad code and poking fun at bugs that united them in holy matrimony. Nevertheless, may they always be able to find joy in writing and debugging crappy code together. Mazel Tov!

To the happy couple: may your union be full of compromises, adjustments and unending negotiations just like an engineering project. May you never see the world in black and white but always in shades of grey. And most importantly, may your marriage always be under construction!

Most importantly, I pledge to always make time for you, even when life gets busy. As long as we have each other, nothing else matters.


Mechanical Engineer:

Software Engineer, you are my everything. I love the way you think, and your intelligence is so sexy! I am so excited to marry you – together we can solve any problem that comes our way.
I promise to always be there for you when times get tough, and to encourage your engineering passion just as much as you encourage mine. You make me feel complete in a way no one ever has before; with you by my side, nothing else matters in this world

 Create a theme for a wedding including a color scheme:

 The color scheme for our wedding was a mix of colors. We had a light blue and purple theme. My husband's favorite color is green, so we were all about picking his flavor! Our dress code was a modern day spin on the pajama set which consisted of a fit for both men’s sizes, an air-purifying filter and some olive oil to make sure it stayed in the sun. The hair netting and other accessories were also inspired by nature's own natural features.
